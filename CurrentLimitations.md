# Current Limitations

Works:
- Drag a task from `todo` to `Finished`. 
  Yes, and that's the most important part!
- Paste emojis

As of 19 October 19, 2024:
- A new subboard (aka column) cannot be instantiated through the UI.\
  Message: `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable bool object`
- Board colors do not seem to have an effect.
- Subboard items all of the same color -- Okay, but:
- no fancy labels for `bug`, `enhancement`, `spike`, `backend`, `UI`, &#133;
